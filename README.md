# Bookstore
frontend and backend of a bookstore database.

Using sqlite3 to connect to the backend where our database is built and imported into the frontend

The front end represents a nice little GUI using tkinter where users can update, delete, add etc to a library of books

Using pyinstaller --onefile --windowed frontend.py in an editor will create a .exe file and build a one stop application.
